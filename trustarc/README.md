## FAQ

Q: I enabled Aggregate and compress CSS files, but admin_menu.css is still
there. Is this normal?

A: Yes, this is the intended behavior. the administration menu module only loads
its stylesheet as needed (i.e., on page requests by logged-on, administrative
users).

A: The free edition of CookiePro includes key features businesses need to comply
with cookie consent requirements across privacy regulations such as the GDPR and
ePrivacy for a single domain with up to 100 subpages.

Q: How do I upgrade my Free Edition of CookiePro?
A: If you would like to upgrade to a Starter, Standard or Enterprise
subscription, simply select the edition you would like to purchase on the
CookiePro pricing page and click “Buy Now”. Once you enter the email associated
with your existing free account, simply follow the checkout process, enter your
payment details and you will have access to your new edition.

Q: Can I add several small websites to 1 subscription?
A: Prices are per domain. Each domain requires one subscription. Cross
sub-domain consent is available.
